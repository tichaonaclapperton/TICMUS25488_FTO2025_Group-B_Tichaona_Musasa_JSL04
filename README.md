# JSL04 Project Brief: Dynamic Task Display & Modal View

## ðŸ“° Overview

In this project, you will dynamically display tasks from the **given initial data** on the DOM using JavaScript. Tasks should be placed into the correct **Kanban board columns** based on their status, and clicking a task should open a **modal** where users can view and modify task details. The project emphasizes **DOM manipulation, event handling, modular JavaScript structure, and responsive UI implementation.**

## Before You Begin

**Check the project user stories in your student dashboard and the updated Figma Design** before you start building.

## ðŸ“– Key Objectives

### Dynamic Task Display & Interaction

- Dynamically generate **task elements** from the given initial data and insert them into the DOM.
- Ensure tasks are placed in the **correct columns** ("To Do", "In Progress", "Done") based on their status.
- Clicking a task should **open a modal** displaying its details.
- The modal should include:
  - **Editable input fields** for the task title and description.
  - **A select dropdown** showing the current status with other status options available.
  - **A close button** that allows users to exit the modal easily.

### ðŸ–¥ Design & Responsiveness

- Ensure the **modal matches the Figma design**, including a **backdrop effect** for focus.
- Implement a **fully responsive modal** that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

### ðŸ§¾ Code Structure & Maintainability

- Structure JavaScript using **modular, single-responsibility functions**.
- Use **descriptive and meaningful variable and function names** for clarity.
- Add **JSDoc comments** to major functions, describing their purpose, parameters, and return values for better documentation.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Clone** or **download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Youâ€™ll see a **task board** with some default tasks.
4. **Click a task** to open it in a modal and edit its content.

> âœ… No build tools or backend required. Everything runs in the browser.




## Expected Outcome

A fully functional **dynamic task board** where tasks appear under the correct columns, and users can **open a modal to view/edit** task details. The project will follow **clean, well-documented, and maintainable code practices**, ensuring a professional and scalable implementation.
